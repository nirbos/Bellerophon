    <h1>Bellerophon</h1>
</div>

Bellerophon is a salmagundi :books: containing of sass helpers, functions, mixins and other sass related stuff I gathered over the years and used in projects. I hope this will ease your work as well :kissing_heart:.

## Installing

Bellerophon is available via `npm` or `yarn`.

```shell
npm install @nirbos/bellerophon
# or
yarn add @nirbos/bellerophon
```

After installing, simply reference Bellerophon in your scss file.

```scss
@import '_b.scss';
```

To reduce misbehaviour when using other libraries and frameworks as well, Bellerophon uses `_b` as namespace.
